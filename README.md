# NandToTetris
Repository of my programming solutions for the NAND to Tetris course.

Context: "NAND to Tetris: Building a modern computer from first principles" is an online computer science course where participants start with simple NAND logic gates and iteratively build larger and more complex components, with the final goal being to build a basic 16-bit computer. In the next step (Project 6), they use a programming language of their choice to script an assembler that translates the computers assembly language into binaries. 

Contents in detail:
The folders contain files for testing the programs. 
project_6 has assembly files.
project_7 has vm (virtual machine) files.
